Circular queue
Enqueue -> rear = (rear + 1) % SIZE
Dequeue -> front = (front + 1) % SIZE

Stack: Used to keep track of the elements in order

Key Learnings: Max rectangular histogram
- use a while loop when using stack
  don't rely always on a for loop
-WE NEED TO KEEP TRACK OF THE PREVIOUS SMALLER ELEMENTS

Key Learnings: Max rectangular histogram
- Before leaving revise when and why were if-cases required
  These are the corner cases

Key Learnings: Truck tour
   - enough test cases and scenarios were not written on paper
   - lack of foresight while writing code
   - increase the volume of new questions rapidly

Key Learnings: Reverse Words in a String
   "Code Inter"
   -Reverse individual words
    "edoC retnI"
   -Reverse complete text
    "Inter Code"

   -be careful about start and end indexes

Key Learnings: Find Maximum size rectangle in Binary Sub-matrix
   -Jumping to a solution without deriving if the examples are right
   -Check if the proposed solution is CORRECT for some example
    before claiming it as an answer

Key Learnings: Maximum element in subarray of size k using Dequeue
   - To check if deque(d) is NOT EMPTY and some other conditions
     while(d and a[i] >= d[-1]):
